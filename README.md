# Capstone_Power_BI_2
## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI report developed in response to a specific problem statement, utilizing the provided dataset. The report aims to address key insights and visualize patterns within the data to assist in making informed decisions.

## Features
**Problem Statement**: Your client is a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. They have various fulfillment centers in these cities for dispatching meal orders to their customers. The client wants to help these centers with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks so that these centers will plan the stock of raw materials accordingly.

The replenishment of most raw materials is done on a weekly basis and since the raw material is perishable, procurement planning is of utmost importance. Secondly, staffing of the centers is also one area wherein accurate demand forecasts are helpful. We have the below information with us in the form of 3 different datasets:

Historical data of demand for a product-canter combination

Product (Meal) features such as category, sub-category, current price, and discount

Information for fulfillment centers like center area, city information, etc.

Here is what we are expecting from you:

You need to come up with a story in Power BI that talks about the level of demand in each center. This analysis needs to be granular enough to include product information as well. The client wants and end to end report to understand which fulfillment areas are doing well and which are not. You can also talk about center-meal combinations to add nuance to your final submission.

**Dataset**: Three datasets are given - fulfilment_center_info.xlsx, Meal_Info.xlsx, Weekly_Demand_Data.xlsx 

**Visualizations**: An overview of the main visualizations and dashboards included in the Power BI report, highlighting key findings and insights.
